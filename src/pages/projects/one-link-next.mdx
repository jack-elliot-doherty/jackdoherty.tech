# Introduction

This project was inspired <a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="no_refferer" >Excalidraws</a> drawing
sharing functionality.From what I could tell from my usage of the site, the drawing data was stored in a
database and the link was a unique identifier for the data.

/>

I wanted to see if I could create a similar functionality but
without storing any data. I also wanted to see if I could create an AllMyLinks type site but with a more design control given to the user.

# The Idea

The idea is to create a site where the user can create a link page with details about themselves, a photo and as many links as required.

This is done by creating a form with sections for personal details, social links and then other links. The social links and other links
sections are expandable to allow the user to add as many links as they want.

the final section is the colour section where the user can choose a background colour, text colour, link icon colour and other link tab colour.

The form data is then base64 encoded and used as a query param for the links display page.
When the user visits the link, the query param is decoded and the form is populated with the data.
