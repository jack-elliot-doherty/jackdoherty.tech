# Introduction

This project was inspired <a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="no_refferer" >Excalidraws</a> drawing
sharing functionality.From what I could tell from my usage of the site, the drawing data was stored in a
database and the link was a unique identifier for the data.

/>

I wanted to see if I could create a similar functionality but
without storing any data. I also wanted to see if I could create an AllMyLinks type site but with a more design control given to the user.

# The Idea

The idea is to create a site where the user can create a link page with an expandable form. The form data is then base64 encoded and used as a query param. When the user visits the link, the query param is decoded and the form is populated with the data.
