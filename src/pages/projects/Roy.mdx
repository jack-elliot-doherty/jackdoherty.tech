# Introduction

Roy is a service that allows users to transcribe live phone calls,
youtube videos and other audio files and edit their transcripts using
our purpose built Transcript editor.

Post processing is also performed on users transcripts to extract insights
such as conversation summaries, key topics discussed and keywords of the conversations.

# Cool Features

- ## Transcript editor

      Purpose built transcript editor to allow users to tweak
      transcripts, rename speakers, jump to keywords in the transcript and some other cool stuff.
      Editor follows along with audio by underlining the word being spoken to allow easy editing.

- ## Search/Sort Table View

  Table view of all transcripts sortable by all table headers
  with search powered by ElasticSearch.

- ## Call Audio recording

          Users can request a Roy room and are then supplied with phone number
          to dial. Upon dialing this number they are entered into the room -
          a beep tone is played and thereafter all audio is recorded - it is then transcribed
          once all users hang up.
