- # Introduction

  Roy is a service that allows users to transcribe live phone calls,
  youtube videos and other audio files and edit their transcripts using
  our purpose built Transcript editor.

  Post processing is also performed on users transcripts to extract insights
  such as conversation summaries, key topics discussed and keywords of the conversations.

        once all users hang up.
