# Introduction

Mayh3m clothing is a clothing brand a friend of mine started.
I built this web app to allow users to apply for new Mayh3m clothing drops.

It's built with Next.js, React, and trpc. It uses NextAuth for authentication,
Prisma for data access, PlanetScale(MySql) for database and is hosted on Vercel.

# Requirements

Mayh3m clothing releases exlcusive clothing drops at intervals throughout the year.
The clothing is only available to those who have applied for the drop and been accepted.
Mayh3m clothing needed a way to allow users to apply for the drops and for the admins to
manage the applications.

In addition to the application process, the admins needed a way to build a community around
the brand. They wanted to be able to post updates and news about the brand and allow users
to stay up to date with the brand.

# Solution

I built{" "}<a target="_blank" rel href="http://www.mayh3m.xyz/">Mayh3m.xyz</a> {" "} to allow users to apply for the
drops and for the admins to manage the applications. Users can create an account with Google, Discord,
or with their email. This site doesn't store any passwords, if a user signs up with their email, they
will receive an email with a sign in link. The site uses NextAuth to handle authentication.

Once a user is signed in, they can apply for the drops. To do this they navigate to a drops page and fill
out the application form.

The application form is built with React Hook Form and the data is sent to the
server using trpc. The server then validates the data and saves it to the database.

Once a user has applied for a drop, they receive a confirmation email and can then not
apply for that drop again. The admins can then review the applications and accept or reject
them. The admins can also view all the applications and filter them by status and drop.

Users can also sign up for Mayh3m newsletter. There is link to the newsletter form on the footer of every page.
This form is also built with React Hook Form and the data is sent to the server using trpc. Users receive  
a confirmation email after signing up for the newsletter and each mail they receive from the newsletter has an
unsubscribe link. The admins can send out newsletter mails to all the users who have signed up for the newsletter.
