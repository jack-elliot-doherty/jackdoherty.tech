# JamBot Job Description

DE-CNI manages and supports a fleet of ~200 kubernetes  
clusters and with that responsibility involves monitoring.

There are 2 ways to see any issues with clusters: Firstly, visit DE-CNIs monitoring dashboard and see a visual
representation of the fleet and any issues. This is an anti-pattern though as it relies on someone checking the
dashboard for issues. Rather the issues should come to us instead of the other way round.
Think of something like pub-sub.

Secondly following this idea, sending emails to DE-CNI detailing the alerts. This still is not a great solution as
the emails are hard to visually parse and arrive every 5 minutes leading you to ignore them often
(I filter them out of my inbox).

So, what follows pub-sub but is easier to read and make use of than visually crowded spammed emails? Jira tickets!
But who is going to sit and raise a Jira ticket every time an alert comes up?

# The Perfect candidate for the Job

We hired JamBot (Jira Alert Manager Bot). JamBot is an automated pipeline that raises DE-CNI support tickets to our
Jira board: each ticket corresponds to an active Prometheus alert for any of our supported clusters.
JamBot populates the tickets with information pertaining to the alert – such as the alert type, the deployment its
relevant to and a description of the alert. JamBot clocks in at 8am and works tirelessly until 7pm, Monday to Friday.

Like any new hire Jambot took some time to find their feet. At first, they raised a ticket per alert resulting in
multiple tickets referring to the same deployment for different alerts appearing on the Jira board. But
after some onboarding courses and a couple knowledge transfer calls, JamBot was working like a well-oiled machine.

# This is my Jam

After JamBots onboarding there were a few obvious improvements that they could make. Sometimes an alert will fire,
stay active for a brief time, and then resolve on its own for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, if JamBot raises a
ticket for one of these “phantom” alerts then the ticket becomes at best redundant and at worst an obstruction on the
Jira board.

So, the solution is for JamBot to start remembering the IDs of the tickets they raised and what alert they were for.
This way whenever the alert gets resolved, they can close the ticket, so it no longer obstructs the board. In
case anyone wonders where the ticket went Jambot can also comment on the ticket to explain why the ticket was closed.

# Upskilling

After some time JamBot had settled into the team well, but raising Jira tickets did not give them the same thrill
that it used to. They wanted more, the next mountain to climb. What if JamBot could solve the alerts themselves?

An instance down type alert is when a cluster is completely nonresponsive from a monitoring context. In most cases a
ix for this is to simply delete and reinstall the monitoring components on the cluster. This gave way to a new automated
pipeline: The cdd_reinstall_monitoring pipeline is an automated version of what is described above; however, it is exposed
via webhook so JamBot can execute it.

JamBot has their jam back at this point being able to raise a ticket for an instance down type alert, call the new
reinstall monitoring pipeline with the deployment the alert mentions and if the alert is resolved
from this, eventually comment on, and close the ticket all themselves with no interaction from anyone else on DE-CNI!

# JamBots Future is Sweet

JamBot has given us the platform to automate procedures based on alert events. This opens some cool possibilities for
novel solutions, it is just up to us to put them on the right training course!
